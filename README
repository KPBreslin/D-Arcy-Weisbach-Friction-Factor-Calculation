The D'Arcy Friction Factor is used extensivley in fluid system design.
Calculating its value can often be cumbersome, and prone to error when performed by hand.
The following little program/function will calculate the D'Arcy Friction Factor given values for the Reynolds Number, Pipe Diameter and Pipe Roughness

Now obviously you can use the several approximations of the implicit Colebrook-White equation such as the Swammee-Jain Equation (which I have also included a function for, it takes the same inputs as the Colebrook-White Equation.
As for most applications 4 significant figures is all that is required, either equation may be used.

Colebrook Equation 
D'Arcy Friction Factor 
Swamee Jain Equation


You are obviously free to use this in any way/shape/form with or without my attribution.
I am only human however and am not liable if anything goes wrong whilst you use this program. If you are a good engineer you would check and triple check all your values.
