The D'Arcy Friction Factor is used extensivley in fluid system design.
Calculating its value can often be cumbersome, and prone to error when performed by hand.
The following little program/function will calculate the D'Arcy Friction Factor given values for the Reynolds Number, Pipe Diameter and Pipe Roughness
